In this assignment, # UX_UI_HW_19, you will find a few animations and interactive elements added. I hope you enjoy the preloading animation, My Work Button, and Scroll to Top feature incorporated through js. The interactions are simple but were quite a challenge as a beginner. I hope to smoothen out the animations and add entry fields to my contact portion along with cleaning up the footer to be more visually pleasing. Thanks!
